Although I love design in general (specifically interior and fashion design) my favorite is undoubtedly the graphic world. For as long as I can remember, I have been artistic and curious about illustration. When I was younger, I used to paint on canvases, then I got more interested in drawing realistic portraits based on pencil and charcoal but now I have moved to the digital stage but I could easily do all of them!",

I like natural makeup, which highlights the features of men and women.",
