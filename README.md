# Mesa_Daniela_Favourite_Things

## Project for MMED - 3039 by Daniela Mesa

### This page shows 3 of my favourite things in life. I think there is no better way to describe myself throught anything else. My 1 favourite thing is Photography. I've been working in some fields but urban pohotography is definitely one of my favourite. I also choose Design; Since i was a child I've always feel attracted to design and fashion. And last but not least Makeup, is something "new" if i can say that, but it has turned out one of my passions in life.

### The dinamic of this page is to show all my 3 favourite things visually, each of them has it's own description, focus and name. For read and see all the information above the 3 photos, you have to click the "learn more" button, as simple as that.

### HTML 5, CSS3, JS, SASS, GULP were used to create this webpage.
